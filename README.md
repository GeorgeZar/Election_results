Deliverable 3: Written Analysis of the Election Audit

Overview of Election Audit: This election has allowed to see the amount of votes per county and the division of votes between the candidates.
It has also showed us the repartition of the areas where the people voted the most for a candidate or the other. This would help the 3 candidates to visit the areas where they has the least votes and try to gain more votes there for the election.
We were able to determine the percentages and the amount of votes every candidate was able to obtain. We found that Denver was among the highest county turnouts.
After calculating those votes, we were able to determine the winning candidate and how many votes they were able to obtain and the percentage of among the 2 other candidates.
